Self Organizable List

Java-based Doubly-Linked List whose elements can reorder based on Move-To-Front, Swap-towards-Front, or Access Count schemas - or without reordering at all.

Also included is a test of each of the three reordering schemes, in Experiment.java. 

This class was originally created as a class assignment, based on an interface provided by Dr. George Novacky in CS 445 (Data Structures) at the University of Pittburgh in the 2012-2013 Spring Semester.
